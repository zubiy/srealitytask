# sreality.cz parser

## Task
 
Use scrapy framework to scrape the first 500 items (title, image url) from sreality.cz (flats, sell) and save it in the Postgresql database. Implement a simple HTTP server in python and show these 500 items on a simple page (title and image) and put everything to single docker-compose command so that I can just run "docker-compose up" in the Github repository and see the scraped ads on http://127.0.0.1:8080 page.

## Run
Run and build project with```docker-compose up```

## Link
Sreality items: [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)
